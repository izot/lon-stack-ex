//	This function is used by the default implementation of isiGetAssembly alone, and might become obsolete as soon as the application
//	overrides IsiGetAssembly (unless of course it continues calling the isiGetAssembly forwardee).
//	In the default implementation, assemblies are always assumed to have a wdith of one, and the assembly number conventiently equals
//	the NV index.
//	This function here finds a NV that matches the CSMO given, starting with (PreviousAssembly+1). First-time callers should set the
//	PreviousAssembly parameter to ISI_NO_ASSEMBLY

	// the get_nv_type function expects the "SI index", not the NV's "global index". This is a problem, because the SI index is not available
	// anywhere (expect when parsing the entire SI data). With normal, simple, NVs, SI index and global index are the same. With NV arrays,
	// however, these are only the same when declared with the bind_info(expand_array_info) modifier (and when linked with some very old
	// system image).
	// For ISI enabled devices, it is therefore recommended to use the bind_info(expand_array_info) modifier with the declaration of NV arrays,
	// or not to declare NV arrays, or to override the IsiGetAssembly() function.
	//
	// This function, _IsiFindLocalNvOfType, is used internally by the default implementations of IsiGetAssembly.
	// This function cannot solve the problem of compacted NV array SI data, but it can detect it and avoid misinterpretation of random data
	// therefore:
	// NvCount is the number of actual network variables, with each array element counting as one.
	// The get_nv_si_count() function returns the number of network variable entries in SI
	// If the two numbers are the same, then get_nv_type() can be used with the NV index as the argument. In this case, the _IsiFindLocalNvOfType()
	// function does what it is supposed to do. When in doubt (the two NV counts won't match), the function says ISI_NO_ASSEMBLY.
	// Thus, if arrays are used without bind_info(expand_array_info), the function will at least not misinterpret arbitrary data.

                // isiDirectionOutput has a value of 0 (zero), wheras the direction flag in the NV config table is cleared (zero) for input NVs.
                // Admittedly this is confusing, but by the time this was detected we didn't feel like we could change this any more, as the product
                // was well into regression test already, and re-defining the enumeration would have broken example applications that had already been
                // programmed into the evaluation boards. So, we live with this discrepancy. Note the test for equality of the direction information
