#include "isi_int.h"

//	Note that calls to IsiUpdateDiagnostics are not only made through this
//	conditional forwarder (in order to control overhead uplink traffic for
//	shortstack, or general overhead burden in all cases), but that this is
//	also a feature controlled via the ISI_SUPPORT_DIAGNOSTICS macro, defined in
//	isi_int.h
//	This allows to create a library version with smaller footprint (and without
//	support for IsiUpdateDiagnostics), and a (slightly) larger one that
//	supports this callback.
//	Whether we're going to use this remains to be seen (subject to resulting ISI
//	footprint), but at least it's in place.
