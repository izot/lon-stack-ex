//	_IsiIsGroupAcceptable retunrns ISI_NOT_ACCEPTABLE if the given Group cannot be accepted,
//	or returns a suitable address table index otherwise. A Group is acceptable if the device is already member
// 	of that group, or if a free address table entry is available
//	Set the Join parameter to TRUE if you want the function to have the side effect of also updating the address
//	table entry accordingly.
