//	Revision 0, February 2005, Bernd Gauweiler
//	Revision 1, June 2005, Bernd Gauweiler: added support for CSMAEX/CSMOEX/CSMREX
//  	29-July-2013, Bernd Gauweiler:
//	The primary CSMO receiver is _IsiReceiveCsmo. In the original (Neuron C)
//	implementation, message processors used to access the incoming message data
//	through pointers into the incoming message buffer. However, with the
//	addition of support for turnaround connections, we had to process some of
//	these messages from other locations, pretending that we just received them.
//	That's why _IsiReceiveCsmo redirects to _IsiReceivePtrCsmo, while code that
//	processes the turnaround enrollment offer calls the latter directly.
//
//	The plain receiver (IsiReceiveCsmo) creates a local temporary copy of the
//	message so that the second-level processor _IsiReceivePtrCsmo can modify
//	this data if required - this may be required to handle short messages.
