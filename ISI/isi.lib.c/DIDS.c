//	the function makes sure both domain table entries are set up correctly in the default domains. This is the
//	standard behavior of an ISI-S device, and the default operation for ISI-DA/-DAS devices. Any custom domain
//	ID and length is accounted for by using the IsiGetPrimary*() functions.

//  July 2005, BG: This function now only looks after the primary domain, but does so for all devices ISI-S/DA/DAS.
//  It is no longer called from IsiStart*(), but from within _IsiInitialize(), and it is no longer being called
//  at each and every reset. However, the secondary domain must be taken care of every time, since LNS is pulling
//  the carpet under our feet otherwise. The code to update the secondary domain has therefore been moved from this
//  routine into _IsiInitialize.
