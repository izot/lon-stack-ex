#include "isi_int.h"
#include "FtxlTypes.h"
//#include <mem.h>

//	8-June-2005, Bernd:
//
//	Transport properties are now being set as follows:
//	FT channel: repeat timer 16ms, tx timer  48ms, group- and non-group-receive timer both 128ms
//	PL channel: repeat timer 16ms, tx timer 192ms, group-receive timer 3072ms, non-group receive timer 768ms
//
//	Brief summary how we arrive at these numbers:
//	FT:	"as fast as possible" seemed to have been the argument here. The Tx Timer is taken from NSS and more or less
//	irrelevant for ISI anyhow, so that's not critical
//	PL: Bob, Bob, Phil and Glen agreed that minimum spacing is OK -> repeat timer of 16ms. The TX Timer is taken from NSS
//	and mostly irrelevant for ISI. The repeat timers are more interesting. The group-receive timer covers 4 maximum-sized ISI
//	packets send from a node that uses an energy-storage power supply on the secondary frequency using 6-byte domain ID
//  (with the domain ID being a Neuron ID), using group addressing or bcast, repeated service, no authentication, no priority,
//	no req/resp, no ACKD service, which take 94.43ms each to transmit, and allows for 3 recharging cycles where the power-supply
//	recharges before the next packet goes out (850ms under worst case conditions).
//	The non-group receive timer makes the same assumptions but uses typical rather then worst-case recharging times of 53ms.
//	The idea was to set the group-receive timer so that duplication detection continues to work for network variables, typical
//	ISI service types and addressing modes assumed. Duplication detection for ISI broadcasts is a nice-to have, but making this
//	timer too long would probably cause a loss of incoming messages at some point due to lack of receive transaction database
//	space. We calculate the non-group receive timer to typical conditions therefore, knowing that ISI messages are not sentitive
//	to duplicates.
