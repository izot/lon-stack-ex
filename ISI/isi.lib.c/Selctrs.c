//	Note that this function is only used by a single caller. A byte ot two can be saved
//	by embedding the function body in the caller directly; however, it is important that
//	this function remains a separate function.
//	When testing aspects of the ISI implementation, testers can override this function by
//	providing their own definition, which might produce a deterministic, or less varied,
//	set of results, allowing to increase probability of duplicates of node IDs, subnet
//	IDs, or selector values.

	//
	//	imaginary do-while-loop? Here's why: the following code would "normally" constist of two nested do-while loops, a boolean
	//	IsUsed variable, and a few "break" statements. Replacing the break statements with goto eliminates the need of the boolean
	//	variable, and putting the label in the right location also eliminates the formal outer do-while loop. It is still there,
	//	as a de-facto loop.
	//	Unconventional, but saves a few bytes of code.
