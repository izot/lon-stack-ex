//	Revision 1, 8-June-2005, Bernd: EPR 37262, need jitter on Tperiod

#include "isi_int.h"

//	Tjitter:
//	ISI message spreading detects distinguishable (broadcast) packets that are less than 1 second apart, and aims at a better
//	distribution by spreading. Spreading means that the second device to bcast a message within that short distance of some other
//	device re-allocates its own bcast slot, therefore hopefully getting the transmissions further apart.
//	If, however, packets are too close to each other, they will corrupt each other and spreading can't catapult them apart. Further,
//	none of the nodes would be aware of the problem. Tjitter addresses this. Tjitter is a small random variation on the time at which
//	a device broadcasts; even if at some point packets actually get send simultaneously (where "simultaneous" really means within
//	94ms on a secondary frequency power line transmission, as the worst case), jittering will set those "simultaneous" packets
//	sufficiently apart so that they no longer wipe themselves out, and so that spreading can kick in and set the packets apart.
//	Tjitter must therefore set packets apart at least by 94ms, and less than 1 second. We therefore implement the jitter as a
//	variation -250ms..+250ms in steps of 250ms.
