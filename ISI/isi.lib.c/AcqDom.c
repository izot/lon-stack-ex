        //  b'cast the service pin message already by now. If, however, the registration button is different
        //  from the service pin, we'll send a service pin message anyhow. This allows for the same installation
        //  paradigm to be used, whether in self-installed or managed mode, helps with transitioning a self-installed
        //  node to a managed network, and helps with generic tools (LNS discovery, NodeUtil, etc).
        //
        //  Note it is important that we send the service pin message first, prior to the regular business of acquiring
        //  the domain: Firstly, this mimicks the regular firmware behavior: when you activate the service pin, the
        //  firmware issues the related message, optionally followed with anything the application might do as a
        //  result of sensing the service pin activation. Secondly, it is important because the DAS assumes that
        //  domain ID donor devices always send the service pin message first, optionally followed by a DIDRQ message.
        //  See MsgDas.c for more details.
        //
        //  Also note this is one of the few operations ISI actually performs even if the engine is running. The intention
        //  is to allow for the same user interface to be used for domain registration, ISI or not. If a non-service pin UI
        //  is used for that operation, just go ahead and call IsiAcquireDomain(). If the SharedServicePin flag is set to
        //  FALSE, we'll send a service pin message in any case.

        // timer is set to ISI_T_RM and the Group field is set to ISI_DIDRQ_RETRIES.

        // procedures are mutually exclusive.
