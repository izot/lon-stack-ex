 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  Example implementations of these functions are provided in 
 *  FtxlNvdFlashDirect.c and FtxlNvdFlashFs.c.  The application developer may 
 *  need to modify these functions to fit the type of non-volatile storage 
 *  supported by the application.
 *
 *  Callback functions are called by the IzoT protocol stack 
 *  immediately, as needed, and may be called from any IzoT task.  The 
 *  application *must not* call into the IzoT Device Stack API from within a

 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  This function opens the data segment for reading.  If the file exists and
