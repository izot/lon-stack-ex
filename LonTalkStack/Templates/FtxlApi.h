 * Process IzoT events. 
 *
 * Remarks:
 * This function must be called periodically by the application.  This

 * protocol stack. Typically this function is called in response to the 
 * <LonEventReady> callback, but must *not* be called directly from a 
 * callback. Instead, the <LonEventReady> callback typically sets an operating 
 * system event to schedule the main application task to call this function.
 *
 * This function must be called at least once every 10 ms.  Use the following 
 * formula to determine the minimum call rate:
 *   rate = MaxPacketRate / (InputBufferCount - 1) 
 * where MaxPacketRate is the maximum number of packets per second arriving 
 * for the device and InputBufferCount is the number of input buffers defined

 * Function: LonPollNv
 * Polls a bound, polling, input network variable.
 *
 * Parameters:

 *
 * Returns:
 * <LonApiError>.
 * 
 * Remarks:
 * Call this function to poll an input network variable. Polling an input network 
 * variable causes the device to solicit the current value of all output network 
 * variables that are bound to this one.
 *
 * The function returns *LonApiNoError* if the API has successfully queued the 
 * request. Note that the successful completion of this function does not
 * indicate the successful arrival of the requested values. The values received 
 * in response to this poll are reported by one or more of calls to the 
 * <LonNvUpdateOccurred> event handler. 
 *
 * LonPollNv operates on input network variables that have been declared with 
 * the Neuron C *polled* attribute, only. Only output network variables that 
 * are bound to the input network variable will be received.
 *
 * Note that it is *not* an error to poll an unbound polling input network 
 * variable.  If this is done, the application will not receive any 
 * <LonNvUpdateOccurred> events, but will receive a <LonNvUpdateCompleted>
 * event with the success parameter set to TRUE.
 */

/*
 *  Function: LonPropagateNv
 *  Propagates the value of a bound output network variable to the network.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *  index - the index of the network variable
 *
 *  Returns:
 *  <LonApiError>.
 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  Note that it is not an error to propagate an unbound non-polled output.  
 *  If this is done, the IzoT protocol stack will not send any updates 
 *  to the network, but will generate a <LonNvUpdateCompleted> event with the 
 *  success parameter set to TRUE.
 *
 *  If LonPropagateNv() returns *LonApiNoError*, the <LonNvUpdateCompleted> 
 *  event will be triggered when the NV update has successfully completed or 
 *  failed.  
 *
 *  If LonPropagateNv() is called multiple times before the network variable is 
 *  sent, the behavior is dependent on whether the network variable has the 
 *  synchronous attribute:
 *
 *    - If the network variable is declared with the Neuron C *sync* attribute, 
 *      the network variable will be sent on the network each time 
 *      <LonPropagateNv> is called (subject to application buffer limits).  
 *      The value sent will be the value of the network variable at the time 
 *      of the call to <LonPropagateNv>.  <LonNvUpdateCompleted> will be 
 *      called each time as well.  
 *    
 *    - If the network variable is *not* declared with the Neuron C *sync* 
 *      attribute, only the latest value of the network variable will be sent 
 *      out onto the network, and the <LonNvUpdateCompleted> function will be 
 *      called only once.  If there are no application buffers available, the 
 *      network variable will be propagated at a later time, when one becomes 
 *      available.

 *  Propagates a service pin message.

 *  Remarks:

 *  The function will fail if the device is not yet fully initialized.
 */

/*
 *  Function: LonSendMsg

 *
 *  Parameters:

 *  priority - priority attribute of the message
 *  serviceType - service type for use with this message
 *  authenticated - TRUE to use authenticated service
 *  pDestAddr - pointer to destination address
 *  code - message code
 *  pData - message data, may be NULL if length is zero
 *  length - number of valid bytes available through pData
 *
 *  Returns:
 *  <LonApiError>.
 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  This function is called to send an explicit message.  For application 
 *  messages, the message code should be in the range of 0x00..0x2f.  Codes in 
 *  the 0x30..0x3f range are reserved for protocols such as file transfer.
 *
 *  If the tag field specifies one of the bindable messages tags 
 *  (tag < # bindable message tags), the pDestAddr is ignored (and can be 
 *  NULL) because the message is sent using implicit addressing.
 *
 *  A successful return from this function indicates only that the message has 
 *  been queued to be sent.  If this function returns success, the IzoT Device 
 *  Stack API will call <LonMsgCompleted> with an indication of the 
 *  transmission success.
 *
 *  If the message is a request, <LonResponseArrived> event handlers are 
 *  called when corresponding responses arrive.

 * ******************************************************************************
 * SECTION: NVD EVENT HANDLER PROTOTYPES
 * ******************************************************************************
 *
 *  This section defines the prototypes for the IzoT Device Stack API event handler 
 *  functions supporting memory for Non-Volatile Data (NVD).
 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  Like callback functions, event handlers are called from the IzoT Device Stack API.  
 *  However, unlike callback functions, event handlers are only called in the 
 *  context of the application task, and only when the application calls the 
 *  <LonEventPump> function. Also, the application can make IzoT Device Stack API 
 *  function calls from within an event handler.
 * 
 *  Complete implementations for these event handlers are provided in 
 *  FtxlNvdFlashDirect.c, and FtxlNvdFlashFs.c. A skeleton implementation 
 *  these event handlers is provided in FtxlNvdUserDefined.c.
 */

/* 
 *  Event: LonNvdStarvation
 *  Signals that the NVD write task has taken more than 60 seconds.

 *  Parameters:
 *  seconds - Number of seconds since the persistent update was scheduled
 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  This event is fired if the non-volatile write task has been locked out for 
 *  more than 60 seconds.  When this event has been received, the application 
 *  may elect to suspend high priority tasks and call <LonNvdFlushData> in 
 *  order to wait for the non-volatile data to be completely written.

/*
 * Function: LonLidCreateStack
 * Initialize the IzoT Device Stack API and the IzoT Transceiver.  This function is

 * pInterface - Pointer to a <LonStackInterfaceData> structure, which contains  
 *   data to define the static attributes of the program 
 * pControlData - Pointer to a <LonControlData> structure, which contains data 
 *   used to control the runtime aspects of the stack.  These aspects can be 
 *   set by the application at runtime. 
 *
 * Returns:
 * <LonApiError>.
 * 
 *  Remarks:
 *  Initializes and configures the IzoT driver and the IzoT protocol 
 *  stack. This must be the first call into the IzoT Device Stack API, and cannot 
 *  be called again until <LonLidDestroyStack> has been called.  After this 
 *  function has been called, the following functions can be called:  
 *  <LonLidRegisterStaticNv>, <LonLidRegisterMemoryWindow>, 
 *  <LonLidStartStack>, and <LonLidDestroyStack>.
 *
 *  Note that the stack expects reasonable values for all of the initialization 
 *  parameters.  The stack does not attempt to provide detailed error information
 *  when a parameter is out of range.
 *
 *  If <LonLidCreateStack> returns any error, the stack will simply not function.  
 *  It will not send or receive  messages over the network.  The service LED 
 *  will be left on (applicationless).
