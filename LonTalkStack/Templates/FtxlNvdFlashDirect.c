 *
 * This section contains macros and structures used to control the flash 
 * access routines.
 *
 * Segment data and the associated transaction bits are stored in flash.  
 * Each segment is defined by one or more contiguous flash blocks dedicated 
 * for that segment. Because no other data can appear in a segment's block, 
 * each segment can be updated independently.
 *
 * Each segment consists of an <NvdTransactionRecord> followed by the segment 
 * data. The transaction record consists of a signature and a transaction state.  
 * The transaction is considered "in progress", meaning that the associated 
 * data is invalid unless the signature is valid AND the txState flag value 
 * is TX_DATA_VALID. Starting a transaction is fast, because all that has to 
 * be done is update the txState to something other than TX_DATA_VALID.  Note 
 * that you can change bits in flash from 1 to 0 without erasing them first.  
 * Starting a transaction only requires invalidating the transaction record, 
 * and so can be done without a time consuming block erase.
 *
 * The location of each segment is calculated at runtime, and recorded in the 
 * segment map array.
