 *
 *  This section defines the prototypes for the FTXL LonTalk API callback 
 *  functions.
 *
 *  Remarks: 
 *  Callback functions are called by the FTXL LonTalk protocol stack 
 *  immediately, as needed, and may be called from any FTXL task.  The 
 *  application *must not* call into the FTXL LonTalk API from within a callback.
 */

/*
 *  Callback: LonEventReady
 *  Signals that an event is ready to be processed.
 *
 * Remarks:
 * This function is called whenever the FTXL LonTalk protocol stack adds a new 
 * event for the  application to process.  Typically, this function is used by 
 * the application to set an operating system event which is then used to 
 * signal the application thread to call the <LonEventPump> function.
 *
 * Note that this is an immediate callback, and therefore can be called at any 
 * time, from any thread.  The application cannot call any FTXL functions from 
 * this callback.

 *  Callback: LonGetCurrentNvSize

 *
 *  Parameters:
 *  index - the local index of the network variable
 *
 *  Returns:     
 *  Current size of the network variable. Zero if the index is invalid.
 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  If the network variable size is fixed, this function should return 
 *  <LonGetDeclaredNvSize>. If the network variable size is changeable, the 
 *  current size should be returned. The default implementation for changeable 
 *  type network variables returns 0, and must be updated by the application 
 *  developer.  
 *
 *  The FTXL LonTalk protocol stack will not propagate a network variable with 
 *  size 0, nor will it generate an update event if a network variable update 
 *  is received from the network when the current network variable size is 0.
 *
 *  Note that even though this is a callback function, it *is* legal for the 
 *  application to call <LonGetDeclaredNvSize> from this callback.

 * SECTION: EVENT HANDLER PROTOTYPES
 * ******************************************************************************
 *
 *  This section defines the prototypes for the FTXL LonTalk API event handler

 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  Like callback functions, event handlers are called from the FTXL LonTalk API.  
 *  However, unlike callback functions, event handlers are only called in the 
 *  context of the application task, and only when the application calls the 
 *  <LonEventPump> function. Also, the application may make FTXL LonTalk API

 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  The pointer to <LonResetNotification> is provided for call compatibility with 
 *  the ShortStack LonTalk Compact API.  For FTXL, the value of 
 *  pResetNotification is always NULL.
 * 
 *  Whenever the FTXL device has been reset, the mode of the device is changed

 *  Note that resetting the FTXL device only affects the FTXL LonTalk protocol

 *  Remarks:
 *  While the device is offline, the FTXL LonTalk protocol stack will not

 *  LonPropagateNv> is called.
 *
 *  Note that offline processing in FTXL differs from that in ShortStack.  
 *  When a ShortStack Micro Server receives a request to go offline, it sends 
 *  the request to the ShortStack LonTalk Compact API, which calls the 
 *  application callback <LonOffline>.  The Micro Server does not actually go 
 *  offline until the <LonOffline> callback function returns and the 
 *  ShortStack LonTalk Compact API sends a confirmation message to the Micro 
 *  Server.  In contrast, the FTXL device goes offline as soon as it receives

 *  The network variable with local index given in this event handler has been

 * 
 *  For an element of a network variable array, the index is the global network

 *  Remarks:

 *  authenticated - TRUE if the message was (successfully) authenticated
 *  code - message code
 *  pData - pointer to message data bytes, might be NULL if dataLength is zero

 *
 *  Remarks:
 *  This event handler reports the arrival of a message that is neither a network

 *  with application message codes in the value range indicated by the 
 *  <LonApplicationMessageCode> enumeration. All pointers are only valid for 
 *  the duration of this event handler. 
 *
 *  If the message is a request message, then the function must deliver a 
 *  response using <LonSendResponse> passing the provided *correlator*.  
 *  Alternatively, if for any reason the application chooses not to respond to 
 *  a request, it must explicitly release the correlator by calling 
 *  <LonReleaseCorrelator>.
 *
 *  Application messages are always delivered to the application, regardless 
 *  of whether the message passed authentication or not. It is up to the 
 *  application to decide whether authentication is required for any given 
 *  message and compare that fact with the authenticated flag. The 
 *  authenticated flag is clear (FALSE) for non-authenticated messages and for
 *  authenticated messages that do not pass authentication. The authenticated 
 *  flag is set only for correctly authenticated messages.
