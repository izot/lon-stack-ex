/*
 * $Log: /VNIstack/Dcx_Dev/Shared/include/LtDriver.h $
 * 
 * 18    6/24/08 7:54a Glen
 * Support for EVNI running on the DCM
 * 1. Fix GCC problems such as requirement for virtual destructor and
 * prohibition of <class>::<method> syntax in class definitions
 * 2. Fix up case of include files since Linux is case sensitive
 * 3. Add LonTalk Enhanced Proxy to the stack
 * 4. Changed how certain optional features are controlled at compile time
 * 5. Platform specific stuff for the DC such as file system support
 * 
 * 1     12/05/07 11:15p Mwang
 * 
 * 17    11/16/07 1:52p Bobw
 * EPR 47445
 * Don't wait for network buffer to become available if none are defined.
 * 
 * 16    8/01/07 5:50p Fremont
 * EPR 45753 - clearing the network statistics of an internal device
 * cleared the console linkstats display, which was intended to show the
 * external packet statistics. In standalone mode on the iLON, this
 * happened automatically on any internal device commission. Solution:
 * keep a shadow shadow copy of the statistics that were actually shared,
 * increment them in the driver, and read/clear the shadow copies when
 * accessing the internal device.
 * 
 * 15    6/20/07 3:58p Bobw
 * Support service pin held function
 * 
 * 14    7/15/05 11:23a Bobw
 * EPR 35786
 * Change LonLinkWin to support the layer 2 mip to be pre-opened.  The
 * VniServer opens the device to determine its mip type (determinMipType).
 * Prior to this change, the VniServer opened the device, and if was a
 * layer 2 mip, closed it, so that lonLinkWin could re-open it.  Now
 * lonLinkWin just uses the handle opened previously (if set).  Note that
 * there are other changes to determinMipType necessary to complete this
 * EPR.
 * 
 * 13    4/12/05 9:45a Bobw
 * EPR 36422
 * Support LDV attachment events for layer 2 mips as well as layer 5 mips.
 * 
 * 12    4/28/04 6:49p Bobw
 * EPR 32593
 * Support VNI based protocol analyzer.  Pass bad packets up, and time
 * stamp them at first oportunity.  
 * 
 * 11    4/23/04 5:25p Bobw
 * Keep track of whether or not read only data has been updated.  Update
 * network buffers only if it has been.  If it hasn't, then refresh the
 * read only data from the driver's cache.  Otherwise we have the
 * situation that stack A sets the read only data and updates the network
 * buffers, then stack B resets, but since it still has stale read only
 * data it sets them back to the old values.  Note that the read only data
 * of a stack will still not be updated with the latest network buffers
 * until it resets - but this seems OK.
 * 
 * 10    4/23/04 4:16p Bobw
 * EPR 32997
 * On Layer2 mip, maintain a cache of network buffers.  On startup, read
 * the buffers from the mip (if they have not already been read), and
 * update the stacks read-only data to reflect the network buffers (but
 * not app buffers).  On reseting a stack, check to see if the buffers in
 * read only data differ from those in the LONLINK cache, and if so, write
 * them back out to the mip.
 * 
 * 9     6/23/03 11:09a Glen
 * Development related to supporting NES devices on top of the new Power
 * Line SLTA.  This includes making phase detection and bi-directional
 * query status work.  Also, changed stack such that if a transceiver ID
 * is unknown, the comm params are left unchanged.
 * 
 * 8     11/06/01 9:25a Glen
 * Need control of zero crossing synchronization and attenuation for
 * LonTalk Validator.  Added these flags to sendPacket().  This propagated
 * to lots of places.  Also added control options to LtMsgOut.
 * 
 * 7     11/01/01 11:54a Fremont
 * Remove dead LtCommParams def (now in own header)
 * 
 * 5     3/14/00 9:53a Darrelld
 * remove ($)Log

 * Add wink support
 * 
 * 2     11/04/99 11:01a Darrelld
