/**
 * This interface defines the methods which must be implemented by an application
 * using the LonTalk Java Stack as implemented via the package LonTalk.Stack and
 * accessed via the class <A href="COM.Echelon.LonTalk.Api.Layer7Api.html">Layer7</A>.  
 * The functions in this interface will be called by the Layer7 class upon receipt 
 * of a message, a timeout, or some other indication.
 * <p>
 * Depending on how the protocol stack is initialized, these callbacks will either be made
 * directly from one of the protocol stack's threads or will be made in the application's
 * thread.  If the function to be performed is at all lengthy or requires sleeping
 * or synchronization, it is recommended that the callback notify or spawn a
 * separate thread of execution to perform the related processing.
 * This is a very strong recommendation if you choose to have the callbacks made
 * directly from the protocol stack's thread.  
 * <p>
 * The use of the protocol stack is limited to a single application.  If more than
 * one application needs to use the protocol stack, arbitration must be handled by an
 * intermediate layer sitting between the protocol stack and the applications.  This intermediate
 * layer then looks like the one and only application to the protocol stack.
 *
 * If the application wishes to support dynamic NVs or changeable NV types, it must
 * also implement the AppDynamic interface.
